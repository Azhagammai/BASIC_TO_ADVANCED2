//     You can also combine the arithmetic operators with the simple assignment operator to create compound assignments. For example, x+=1; and x=x+1; both increment the value of x by 1.

// The + operator can also be used for concatenating (joining) two strings together, as shown in the following ConcatDemo program:



        String firstString = "This is";
        String secondString = " a concatenated string.";
        String thirdString = firstString+secondString;
        System.out.println(thirdString);
    }

// By the end of this program, the variable thirdString contains "This is a concatenated string.", which gets printed to standard output.
